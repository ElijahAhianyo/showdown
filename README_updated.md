_Document generation aided by **Documatic**_

## Getting started

* python 3.6 or greater
* Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Codebase is not installable as a python package 

### Config

This project uses `environs` to load environment variable from a `.env` file.
**Do not add the .env to source control.**
The following environment variables are accepted

```
BATTLE_BOT              default = safest
SAVE_REPLAY
USE_RELATIVE_WEIGHTS
GAMBIT_PATH
MAX_SEARCH_DEPTH
DYNAMIC_SEARCH_DEPTH
GREETING_MESSAGE
WEBSOCKET_URI           sim.smogon.com:8000
PS_USERNAME
BOT_MODE
TEAM_NAME               None
POKEMON_MODE
RUN_COUNT               1
ROOM_NAME
```

### Docker

The project uses Docker to build a maintainable environment for the project, using python:3.6-slim as a base image.
The container uses ENV variables `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`, `GAMBIT_PATH=gambit-enummixed`.
The entrypoint to the Docker container is `run.py`:

It runs an asynchronous function `run.showdown`:
It creates a configuration file from system environment variables.
It runs a loop which challenges a user or accepts a match
and runs a pokemon battle.
The loop tracks the number of wins, losses, and battles run.
The loop breaks if more battles are run than the config value.
Raises a ValueError if the bot mode is invalid.

### Developers

* Unit tests are stored in `tests/` (uses unittest)
* There are no specific developer requirements
* The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

| CI File | Purpose |
|:--------|:--------|
| `.github/workflows/pythonapp.yml` | Runs unit tests. Executes on push to branch `master` and pull request to branch `master` |


## Code Overview

### Entrypoints

There are 0 source code entrypoints in top-level `__main__`/`__init__` files.
The codebase has a flat structure with no central package.
Source code is in:
`data/`,
`showdown/`,
`teams/`.

### Class structure

#### showdown.battle.Battle

The `showdown.battle.Battle` base class has 4 child classes:
* `showdown.battle_bots.most_damage.main.BattleBot`
* `showdown.battle_bots.nash_equilibrium.main.BattleBot`
* `showdown.battle_bots.ou_scraped_teams.main.BattleBot`
* `showdown.battle_bots.safest.main.BattleBot`

```python

```

```python
    def prepare_battles(self, guess_mega_evo_opponent=True, join_moves_together=False)
```

Returns a list of battles based on this one
The battles have the opponent's reserve pokemon's unknowns filled in
The opponent's active pokemon in each of the battles has a different set.

#### showdown.battle_bots.most_damage.main.BattleBot

class showdown.battle_bots.most_damage.main.BattleBot(*args, **kwargs)
```

```python
    def find_best_moves(self)
```

It loops through
