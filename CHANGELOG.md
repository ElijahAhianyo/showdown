* Minimum of 1 damage to status effects; this will allow the bot to see them as shedinja counters
* Better decision logs
* Regenerator to the instruction generation logic
* Technoblast to specialeffects; moved move modification to the first modification; changed healing to only generate an instruction if health recovered is > 0

* Depth=1 to re-order the botmoves more optimally
* Lru_cache for caching state transposition
* Heavy imports to functions (they are optional)
* Requirements for nash to its own text file
* Pu sample
* The end of turn instructions to happen independently
* Random battle data if the pokemon is not in the lookup

### Fixed

* Typo in readme
* Improperly named variable and removed bad use of 'assert'
* Priority setting for prankster and added logic to account for if trickroom is in effect
* Bug where 'boost' and 'self, boost' were always affecting the bot's pokemon, not the attacker

* Error in psyshock logic; the calculation was accidentally reversed
* Bug where recoil/healing moves caused pokemon to go aboveor below max health
* Bug where regenerator acgivated on 0hp pokemon
* Nasty bug that caused evaluation in non-random battles to be incorrect; this should result in better performance in modes like ou
* Bugs with pokemon initialization and with searching through trapped/force-switch states
* Typo in tests
* State serialization incorrectness introduced with trickroom
* State instruction generation bugs
* Bug in get options and added some tests
* Bug where there was an attempt to decrement pp for an unknown move
* Bug with magicguard and end of turn instructions
* Bug with end of turn instructions
* Incorrect calculation for eviolite and assaultvest
* Bug where attack boosts of own pokemon affected foulplay damage it dealt (#8)
* Docker build fetch update issues (#21)
* Tests and heal_or_damage
* Some mechanics (#33)
* Intimidate that should not create 0 boost
* Crash when multiattack is used by itemless pokemon
* Thunderouskick and raise valueerror if an incorrect boost is sent in
